# Portfolio Starter Kit

## Objectives

- Create a badass portfolio website
- Get a custom domain name for our website
- Make some Case Studies to show off our work

## What is the Portfolio?

This isn't a stupid question - while most people know they _need_ a portfolio website, they don't know exactly what should be in it. This is evident by the hundreds of [bad](http://eighty-twenty.net/) [portfolio sites](http://theworstportfolioever.com/) you'll find floating around.

Your Porfolio website should serve two purposes - **showcase your work**, and **provide a way to contact you**. Everything in your portfolio should drive these two tenents.

### Portfolio: Anatomy

At the minimum, your portfolio should have:
- Your name and role
- Contact info
- Examples of work (Case Studies)
- Resume (PDF)
- A little something about yourself (not too much)

### Portfolio: Best practices
- Generally, your website should be only one page, with individual pages for case studies/projects
- Don’t reinvent the wheel - this is a utility, not an art project. Stick to layouts and flows that work

## How do I make a website?

Great question. Unless you're comfortable with frontend development, I suggest using [SquareSpace](squarespace.com). For $12/mo (+ ~$20 a year for a domain name), you can utilize their pre-built templates and easily upload your own work into it.

### Domain names

When you pay SquareSqace to host your website, you're essentially renting a folder on a server - kind of like renting an apartment. A server is just a normal computer with special software on it that allows anyone to access and view its contents. 

However, this digital apartment's address is gonna be kind of hard to remember - by default it will be an IP address. An IP address is a long, unique string of numbers that represent's the site address on the internet. For instance, going to 72.21.215.90 will take you to Amazon.

In order to make a human-friendly address, you'll need to buy a domain name (sometimes refered to as DNS, i.e. Domain Name System). For $10-$20 a year, you can attach a fancy name like [NickAnderson.Rocks](http://NickAnderson.Rocks) to your otherwise unrecognizable website. 

SquareSpace allows you to purchase a Domain Name through them - **this is your best option, as its often difficult to coordinate the ownership of your DNS.** If you just want to be difficult by buying your Domain Name from a third-party, make sure you buy your domain from a reputable company, like [Google](https://domains.google/#/). There is a [very real blackmarket for Domain Names](https://gimletmedia.com/episode/7-this-website-is-for-sale/) that you will want to avoid.

### Top Level Domains

![URL anatomy](http://eloquence.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/URL-anatomy.jpg)

Your website can end with a lot more than .com - here's a complete rundown:

- .com - standard, totally fine

- .co - cool and new, common amongst web devs

- .___ (new top level domains): http://data.iana.org/TLD/tlds-alpha-by-domain.txt - great if relevant (for instance, .design or .work)

- .net, .biz - NEVER.

## Domain-Specific Email Addressses

SquareSpace offers a custom email address through your DNS - i.e., Nick@NickAnderson.Rocks. Using that service is up to you - they cost money, and will give you a new, additional inbox to manage or import into your existing one. The effect of a personalized email address on your DNS conveys an even more polished and professional presentation. 

On the other hand, it's perfectly normal to have a generic gmail address not associated with your website as your main point of contact. I've used that for years.

## UX Case Studies

**A case study is a story about a UX problem you solved**. Usually presented as a PDF or single webpage, it steps through the challenge, approach and solution presented to you by a client. The same way a programmer might showcase screenshots of a finished website and descriptions of the code and languages used, you'll be using visuals and short text snippets to describe your UX work.

### Case Studies: Anatomy

- Structure in the PTAR (or STAR) method: Problem, Task, Action, Result
	- **Problem**: Why were you hired? What made them decide to pay for design?
	- **Task**: What corrective service were you asked to perform? Generally, this is the inverse of the Problem
	- **Action**: What did you do to achieve the Task? Go into detail. This is where your problem solving skills come through.
	- **Result**: Show us the results, visually or in text. Not just how it looked - did sales go up? Did customer retention increase?
- Visuals: 'Before' images (if design was visually updated), Wireframes, Sketches, Mockups (any type of proccess), Final Result
- Text: Break the project down into pieces, and explain your reasoning
- Data: Bring in whatever data you can to support your work

### Case Studies: Best practices

- There is no “template” for case studies. Each one should be hand-made to tell the story you want
- You are telling a story here, with words and visuals. All that matters is the narrative
- Start with the Result - much like a pull-quote from an article, people like to hear a quick summary of what they’re about to read before going in.
